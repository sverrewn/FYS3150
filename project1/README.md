# Project 1

The recommended way to run all the code for the project is to execute the run.sh bash script

` ./run.sh [-s|-d] -[c]`

The script might need permission to execute (`chmod a+x run.sh`)

The script will by default save (the `-s` flag) all data files generated in the sub folder data/.  You can optionally delete all this data after the script has run by passing the `-d` flag instead. The `-c` flag will call make clean, deleting all compiled binaries, object files and latex compilation flags.  All plots are saved in the sub folder plots/. 



To manually run the project, compile with `make all` which will build the files with the `-O3` compiler flag.

`poisson_exact.out n` takes an integer, $n$, as argument, specifying how many data points you want to make 

`general_tridiag.out` takes an integer, $n$, as argument, specifying how many data points you want to make

`timing.out` takes no arguments

To plot the project there exists several python scripts

`plot_pr2.py` expects one data file from `poisson_exact.out`. We have used the one generated for $n=1000$

`plot_pr7.py` takes any number data files (from `general_tridiag.out`) 

`plot_pr8.py` takes any number data files, but expects there to be an equal amount of data files, and for each pair of files to have been run with the same $n$, from `general_tridiag.out` and `poisson_exact.out` . All the `general_tridiag.out` files must come <u>**after**</u> the `poisson_exact.out`, but the internal order of each group of files doesn't matter.

`table_pr8.py` takes the same arguments as `plot_pr8.py` in the same way.

`table_pr10.py` takes one data file, generated by `timing.out`

please use the script
